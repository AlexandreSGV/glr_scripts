# glr_scripts
This repository contains the scripts used in the search process for gray literature sources in the article "A Gray Literature Review on Data Stream Processing applications testing" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164121223001395).

There are two scripts:

save_website_to_pdf: This script opens a CSV file containing a list of URLs, and for each URL, it generates PDF files of these webpages.

search_in_google: This script facilitates a Gray Literature Review (GLR) by automating the search process on Google. It executes predefined queries (search_strings) both in Google's general search and within selected target websites (target_websites), streamlining the collection of relevant literature.
